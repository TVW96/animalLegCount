## Code Submission Requirements 
Submit a link to your Github repository
Github repository should contain 
Diagrams or flowcharts that can help you and the interviewer stay on the same page
Clarifying questions
Test cases using unit test frameworks. You should have test cases for normal cases as well as edge cases (we expect you to have at least 3 test cases testing normal cases and at least 3 test cases testing edge cases)
Time and Space complexity of your solution. 

## Video Submission Requirements
Record a video of yourself solving the problem as if you were in a coding interview
You need to show your screen and your face in the video
Talk through your coding and diagramming process. Explain why you are making certain decisions. This helps the interviewer follow your approach
You need to present test cases and demonstrate that you are passing those cases.(we expect you to have at least 3 test cases testing normal cases and at least 3 test cases testing edge cases)
You need to present Time and Space complexity of your solution. 
 If possible, refine your solution to improve its time and space efficiency. Explain the trade-offs and how the optimization improves the original solution.
Maintain clear communication throughout the interview. Reiterate this point, as it's crucial and worth repeating.
Submit a youtube link (public or unlisted)
